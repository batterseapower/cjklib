News & Changes

SVN
===
- Options -c, -b, -e in cjknife are now deprecated. Use wildcards % and _
  for these functions instead.
- Index tables (e.g. CEDICT_Words) are deprecated and will not be generated
  anymore.
- Dictionaries are now built with a case-insensitive collation for SQLite and
  MySQL. For case-insensitive searches via cjklib.dictionary these dictionaries
  need to be newly created.
- Whitespace and 'u:' vowel correction for HanDeDict and CEDICT are not done
  at build time anymore, now leaving the source data untouched. For correct
  searches in reading information these dictionaries need to be newly created.
- cjklib.conf needs any SQLAlchemy options to start with string 'sqlalchemy.',
  e.g. 'sqlalchemy.echo = True'. Option 'url' is the only possible exception.
- The precedence of config files changed: .cjklib.conf (or cjklib.conf) in '~'
  will now have a heigher weight over /etc/cjklib.conf.
