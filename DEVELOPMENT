Test cases
------------
Run
  python runtest.py
to run the test cases included in cjklib/test.py.

Coverage
------------
Using the coverage tool by Gareth Rees included in Debian as python-coverage
code coverage can be derived by using the unit tests:
  python-coverage -x runtest.py

Coverage results can be shown for each file with e.g.:
  python-coverage -a cjklib/reading.py
which creates the file cjklib/reading.py,coverage.

The accumulated coverage in file .coverage can be deleted using
  python-coverage -e

Profiling
------------
Profiling is mostly used to learn about the runtime behaviour of a program
and find inefficient parts of the code. It also allows epydoc to generate call
graphs for inclusion in the API documentation:
  python -m cProfile -o unittest.pstat runtest.py
generates the file unittest.pstat that is used for further processing.

Documentation
------------
Epydoc is used to generate the API documentation:
  epydoc -v --config epydoc_config
