u"""
Han character library. Cjklib provides language routines related to Han
characters (characters based on Chinese characters named Hanzi, Kanji, Hanja and
chu Han respectively) used in writing of the Chinese, the Japanese, infrequently
the Korean and formerly the Vietnamese language(s). Functionality is included
for character pronunciations, radicals, glyph components, stroke decomposition
and variant information.

Examples
========
    - Get characters by pronunciation (here: "국" in Korean):

        >>> from cjklib import characterlookup
        >>> cjk = characterlookup.CharacterLookup('T')
        >>> cjk.getCharactersForReading(u'국', 'Hangul')
        [u'匊', u'國', u'局', u'掬', u'菊', u'跼', u'鞠', u'鞫', u'麯', u'麴']

    - Get characters by components (yielding glyphs):

        >>> cjk.getCharactersForComponents([u'门', u'⼉'])
        [(u'\u9605', 0), (u'\u960b', 0)]

    - Get stroke order of characters:

        >>> cjk.getStrokeOrder(u'说')
        [u'\u31d4', u'\u31ca', u'\u31d4', u'\u31d2', u'\u31d1', u'\u31d5',\
u'\u31d0', u'\u31d3', u'\u31df']

    - Convert pronunciation data (here from I{Pinyin} to I{IPA}):

        >>> from cjklib.reading import ReadingFactory
        >>> f = ReadingFactory()
        >>> f.convert(u'l\u01ceosh\u012b', 'Pinyin', 'MandarinIPA')
        u'lau\u02e8\u02e9.\u0282\u0285\u02e5\u02e5'
