# Mapping of Mandarin Chinese syllables from the Wade-Giles romanisation to
# Pinyin.
#
# Source:
#   *  Ireneus László Legeza: Guide to transliterated Chinese in the modern
#      Peking dialect. Conversion tables of the currently used international and
#      European systems with comparative tables of initials and finals. E. J.
#      Brill, Leiden, 1968.
#      This uses "A Chinese-English dictionary" (H. A. Giles, London, 1892) as
#      bibliographic source.
#
#      Some Wade-Giles forms are wrong and have been corrected here:
#      'pie' to 'pieh' and Pinyin forms 'lue' and 'nue' to 'lüe' and 'nüe'.
#      Missing in this source are Wade-Giles forms ei, êng, o, yo and yai.
#      Some forms don't occur in the bibliographic source and have been deduced
#      by the author: ts’ei, jua, sei, shei, t’ei.
#      Forms ei and êng have been added as they are clearly deducible in the
#      initial/final system.
#
# Some forms listed are old, dialect forms and not used today. Pinyin forms
# should not map to those and thus an index is used to separate them from normal
# ones.
#
# Missing mappings for syllables in Pinyin:
#   SELECT DISTINCT Pinyin FROM PinyinSyllables WHERE Pinyin NOT IN (SELECT
#   Pinyin FROM WadeGilesPinyinMapping);
#   * dia
#   * e
#   * fe
#   * fiao
#   * hm
#   * hng
#   * lo
#   * m
#   * me
#   * n
#   * ne
#   * ng
#   * o
#   * yai
#   * yo
#   * zhei
#
# Missing mappings for syllables not in Pinyin (and thus not included in list):
#   * "lüan","lüan",0
#   * "lün","lün",0
#   * "sei","sei",0
#
# The mapping from Wade-Giles to Pinyin isn't injective, even for preferred
# forms:
#   SELECT a1.WadeGiles, a2.WadeGiles, a1.Pinyin FROM WadeGilesPinyinMapping a1,
#   WadeGilesPinyinMapping a2 WHERE a1.Pinyin = a2.Pinyin
#   AND a1.WadeGiles < a2.WadeGiles AND a1.PinyinIdx = 0 AND a2.PinyinIdx = 0;
#   * o, ê for ê
#   * ko, kê for ge
#   * ho, hê for he
#   * k’o, k’ê for ke
#   * i, yi for yi
