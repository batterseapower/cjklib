# Mapping of Mandarin Chinese syllables from the Wade-Giles romanisation to
# Pinyin.
#
# Relation to other sources:
#   * Library of Congress Pinyin Conversion Project - New Chinese Romanization
#     Guidelines: http://www.loc.gov/catdir/pinyin/romcover.html, 28.05.1999
#     This list contains syllables taken from Dìmíng Hànzì Yìyīnbiǎo
#     (名漢字譯音表, 1971) and ALA-LC romanization tables (1997) for the
#     Wade-Giles parts and furthermore Xiàndài Hànyǔ Cídiǎn (现代汉语词典, 1983)
#     for the Pinyin parts.
#     All entries of the Wade-Giles to Pinyin mapping table are included in this
#     list.
#
#   * Pinyin.info - Romanization comparison chart, Hanyu Pinyin romanization
#     system for Mandarin Chinese:
#     http://www.pinyin.info/romanization/compare/wadegiles.html, 15.04.2004
#     Entries for which a Pinyin syllable exists in the PinyinSyllables table
#     (as of 18.02.2008) and a Wade-Giles syllable doesn't contradict an entry
#     found in the LoC table above are included here.
#
# Mapping for 'szu' to 'si' (additional to 'ssu') isn't found in either of
# these tables.
#
# Missing mappings for syllables in Pinyin:
#   SELECT DISTINCT Pinyin FROM PinyinSyllables WHERE Pinyin NOT IN (SELECT
#   Pinyin FROM WadeGilesPinyinMapping);
#   * n
#   * ng
#   * chua
#   * fe
#   * lo
#   * o
#   * dia
#   * eng
#   * kei
#   * rua
#
# The mapping from Wade-Giles to Pinyin isn't injective so it has to be
# augmented by an additional index for Pinyin syllables. Value '0' marks the
# entry to choose as default for a mapping from Pinyin.
