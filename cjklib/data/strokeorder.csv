# Chinese character stroke order table
#
# Glyph information is synchronised with tables StrokeOrder and
# LocaleCharacterGlyph.
# Field 'StrokeOrder' uses abbreviated stroke names as found in table 'Strokes'
# with strokes separated by a space or by a hyphen allowing for grouping of
# parts.
#
# Column 'Flags' holds the following flags:
#   * 'O': Checked, which means the entry has been through a quick check
#   * 'S': The character variant described is only found as a subpart in another
#          character
#   * 'A': Alternative stroke order
#
# Note that some forms are seemingly double. These probably are radical forms
# that are separately encoded in Unicode.
#
# TODO: Alternative stroke order ('A') should be attributed to an existing
#   glyph, not add another one.
