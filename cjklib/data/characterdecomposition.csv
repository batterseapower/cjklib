# Chinese character decomposition table.
#
# The decomposition entry consists of an extended Ideographic Description
# Sequence (IDS, see the Unicode standard). Entries don't follow the
# restrictions made in the Unicode standard and can contain extra character
# z-variant information.
# E.g.
#    '榱','⿰木[1]衰',,,,
#    The left part of the character consists of a z-variant of the character
#    木 (last stroke is a 點 instead of a 捺), here indexed by the number 1. The
#    right part is the subcharacter 衰.
#
# Z-Variant information is synchronised with tables StrokeOrder and
# LocaleCharacterVariant.
#
# Column 'Flags' holds the following flags:
#   * 'O': Checked, which means the entry has been through a quick check
#   * 'S': The character variant described is only found as a subpart in another
#          character
