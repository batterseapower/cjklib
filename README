Cjklib is a library providing Han character related methods for CJKV languages
(Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese).

Introduction
============
Cjklib provides language routines related to Han characters (characters based
on Chinese characters named Hanzi, Kanji, Hanja and chu Han respectively) used
in writing of the Chinese, the Japanese, infrequently the Korean and formerly
the Vietnamese language(s). Functionality is included for character
pronunciations, radicals, glyph components, stroke decomposition and variant
information.

Installing
==========

Windows
-------
Install cjklib using the provided .exe installer.

Two scripts cjknife.exe and buildcjkdb.exe will be added to the Python "Scripts"
sub-directory. Add this directory to your PATH environment variable to access
these programs from the command line.

CJK dictionaries are not included by default. If you want to install any of
those run the following (with an Internet connection) from the root directory
of the source package:

$ cd files
$ install.bat CEDICT

This will download CEDICT, create a SQLite database file and install it under
the directory given by the APPDATA environment variable, e.g.
"C:\windows\profiles\MY_USER\Application Data\cjklib". Just substitute CEDICT
for any other supported dictionary (i.e. EDICT, CEDICT, HanDeDict, CFDICT,
CEDICTGR).

DEB or RPM based systems
------------------------
Install from the provided .deb or .rpm packages. See below for installing
dictionaries.

Linux
-----
If you are installing from the source package you need to deploy the library on
your system:

$ python setup.py install

CJK dictionaries are not included by default. If you want to install any of
those run the following (with an Internet connection):

$ cd files
$ make CEDICT
$ sudo make install

This will download CEDICT, create a SQLite database file and install it to
/usr/local/share/cjklib. Just substitute CEDICT for any other supported
dictionary (i.e. EDICT, CEDICT, HanDeDict, CFDICT, CEDICTGR).


Documentation
=============
The API under http://cburgmer.nfshost.com/cjklib/ includes a lot of
documentation. Also see the project page.


Usage
=====
The main components of this package are accessible through a Python library.
There is a small command line tool 'cjknife' that offers some of the library's
functions. See "cjknife --help" for an overview.


Database
========
Packaged versions of the library will ship with a pre-built SQLite database
file. You can easily rebuild the database yourself.

First download the newest Unihan file:
$ wget ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Unihan.zip

Then start the build process:
$ buildcjkdb build cjklibData

SQLite
------
Currently only characters from the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) of Unicode
are supported, due to missing support in Windows versions of Python and MySQL
(see below). To enable full support set wideBuild to "True" in cjklib.conf
before rebuilding or pass "--wideBuild=True" to buildcjkdb.

SQLite by default has no Unicode support for string operations. Optionally the
ICU library can be compiled in for handling alphabetic non-ASCII characters.
Cjklib can register own Unicode functions if ICU support is missing. Queries
with LIKE will then use function lower(). This compatible mode has negative
impact on performance and as it is not needed for dictionaries like EDICT or
CEDICT it is disabled by default. See cjklib.conf for enabling.

SQLite offers full-text search with extension FTS3 which needs to be compiled in
to be used. Cjknife can use the full-text capabilities for the dictionary search
and performs a full table scan in fuzzy search if this extension is not
available. To enable it set enableFTS3 to True in cjklib.conf before rebuilding.
No full-text support is currently given for MySQL.

MySQL
-----
With MySQL 5 the following CREATE command creates a database with utf8 as
character set using the general Unicode collation:

CREATE DATABASE cjklib DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;

You might need to set access rights, too (substitute user_name and
host_name):

GRANT ALL ON cjklib.* TO 'user_name'@'host_name';

Now you need to change cjklib.conf to tell cjklib to use MySQL.

MySQL < 6 doesn't support true UTF-8, and uses a version with max 3 bytes, so
characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) can't be encoded. Building
the Unihan database thus might result in warnings, characters above 0x20000
can't be built at all.
