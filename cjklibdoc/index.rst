cjklib --- Han character library
================================

Cjklib provides language routines related to Han characters (characters based
on Chinese characters named Hanzi, Kanji, Hanja and chu Han respectively) used
in writing of the Chinese, the Japanese, infrequently the Korean and formerly
the Vietnamese language(s). Functionality is included for character
pronunciations, radicals, glyph components, stroke decomposition and variant
information.

This document is about version |version|, see http://cjklib.org/ for the newest
and http://cjklib.org/current for the current development version. The project
is hosted on http://code.google.com/p/cjklib.

Examples
========

Get characters by pronunciation (here: "국" in Korean):
    >>> from cjklib import characterlookup
    >>> cjk = characterlookup.CharacterLookup('T')
    >>> cjk.getCharactersForReading(u'국', 'Hangul')
    [u'匊', u'國', u'局', u'掬', u'菊', u'跼', u'鞠', u'鞫', u'麯', u'麴']

Get stroke order of characters:
    >>> cjk.getStrokeOrder(u'说')
    [u'㇔', u'㇊', u'㇔', u'㇒', u'㇑', u'㇕', u'㇐', u'㇓', u'㇟']

Convert pronunciation data (here from *Pinyin* to *IPA*):
    >>> from cjklib.reading import ReadingFactory
    >>> f = ReadingFactory()
    >>> f.convert(u'lǎoshī', 'Pinyin', 'MandarinIPA')
    u'lau˨˩.ʂʅ˥˥'

Access a dictionary (here using Jim Breen's EDICT):
    >>> from cjklib.dictionary import EDICT
    >>> d = EDICT()
    >>> d.getForTranslation('Tokyo')
    [EntryTuple(Headword=u'東京', Reading=u'とうきょう', Translation=u'/(n) Tokyo (current capital of Japan)/(P)/')]
